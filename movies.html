            <p>My favorite movie is monsters university because it is one of my favorite disney movies. <br> Another thing that I like about this movie is that it is funny and enjoyable to watch my favorite characters intereact with one another.<br> My favorite character in this movie is Mike Wizoski because he proves that any one can could be the best. I also liked how this movie inspire kids to work hard to achieve there goals even if others belive that you canno't do it I think is a good movie to show  kids. My favorite scene from this movie was when some tour guide said that we have the best cheff's in the world but they put garbage over the trays. I had a good time watching this movie with my family and my friend and I still would watch this still today. </h2>

         <p> I really like this movie because it is action pack and it even more funny then any star wars movie . when I was in the theaters to  watch this movie when I was hearing the opening intro of this movie It gave me chills . I liked the cast in this movie because it bring back the old cast fromther older movies and I am ok about the newer ones not like episodes 1,2,3. I liked and I did not like how they killed my favorite character from star wars but I liked how it shocked me that his son killed him and his son is kro ren. The only bad part of the movie was when ant the ending it left us of with a clift hanger when Luke Skywalker and Ray were staring at each other from a far away diatance then the credits start to pay out. I would rate this movie 5 stars and if you watch it you will have and great time watching this with your friends your dad or yourself.
