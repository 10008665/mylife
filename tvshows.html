               My favorite tv show is the flash because it is entertaining to watch one of mine favorite superhero because he is a fun and he is not to serious like batman or stephane Amell Green Arrow.<br>  In this movie is about a science tist that works with police and then gets hit by lightning  then becomes the flash.<br> His superpower is that he can run very fast he can slow down time also  he can fase through anything.<br> I like Grant Gustin to play the flash and I hope he plays him  for alot of seasons.<br>Zoom is the new villain in the flash he wears a black coustume version of the Flash and he has the same powers then the Flash I like zoom because He is a scarry villain because when he talks. I hope flash can take down zoom.
