               One of my favorite hobbies is to go running/jogging. I like to go jogging around my block or on the beach because it is very dificult thing to do. Right now I am in currently on the track team after school. I like Track because I like to go running and to meet new people and introducing myself to other people . I personily think that track is a very hard sport because we do long run's for 5 or 6 miles. My best personoal mile time is 5:45 but My current time is 5:58 the thing that I think how I got that time I probropbly sprint through the first lap and I was trying to get a good start so that if I am slowing down then my time will be okay. On tuesday I raced in a meet and I beat my time and My time was 5:37. I hope I can improve on this time.
